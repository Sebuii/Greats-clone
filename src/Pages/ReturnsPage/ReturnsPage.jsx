      answer:
        "We gladly accept returns of UNWORN merchandise within 30 days  of delivery except outlet items, which are final sale and may not be returned or exchanged. RETURN VIA MAIL: You can print a shipping label and drop off your return at any USPS post office. You will receive an email when your return is received and your refund has been processed. Shipping charges are not refundable and there is a $6.95 per order return fee that covers restocking and postage back to the warehouse. Refunds are always issued to the original method of payment. To prevent a delay in refund, returns must be shipped back within 7 days since the return label was issued. Start by visiting our RETURNS CENTER.",

Try On Indoors: Shoes should be tried on indoors on a clean surface. Shoes received in a condition with excess wear or damage may not qualify for a return or exchange.",
